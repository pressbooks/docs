Following these instructions will give you a local development network of Pressbooks based on [roots/bedrock][1] and [roots/trellis][2], with the following features:

*   Unit testing via [PHPUnit][3]
*   Code standards evaluation via [PHP_CodeSniffer][4]
*   Build tools for plugin assets via [Yarn][5] and [webpack][6].

## 1\. Dependencies

Install Git for Windows: <https://git-for-windows.github.io/>

Install PHP7 and Composer: <http://kizu514.com/blog/install-php7-and-composer-on-windows-10/>

Install Node.js LTS: <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>

Install Yarn: [https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install][7]

Install Virtual Box: <https://www.virtualbox.org/>

Install Vagrant: <https://www.vagrantup.com/>

At the Command Prompt, install the following Vagrant plugins:

    vagrant plugin install vagrant-bindfs
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-winnfsd
    

Windows users run Ansible on the VM (since it's running Ubuntu) and not locally. You do not need to install Ansible manually.

## 2\. Setup

Start [Git Bash][8] *(it comes with Git For Windows)*

Create a directory for your local development environment and `cd` there:

`mkdir ~/Code/pressbooks-dev && cd ~/Code/pressbooks-dev`

Clone [pressbooks/trellis][9] into `~/Code/pressbooks-dev/trellis`:

`git clone git@github.com:pressbooks/trellis.git`

Clone [pressbooks/bedrock][10] into `~/Code/pressbooks-dev/site`:

`git clone git@github.com:pressbooks/bedrock.git site`

Add [pressbooks/pressbooks][11], [pressbooks/pressbooks-publisher][12] and [pressbooks/pressbooks-book][13] to your Bedrock dependencies (for more information on this strategy, [see this post][14])

    cd ~/Code/pressbooks-dev/site
    composer.phar require pressbooks/pressbooks:dev-dev
    composer.phar require pressbooks/pressbooks-publisher:dev-dev
    composer.phar require pressbooks/pressbooks-book:dev-dev

## 3\. Configuration

Edit `~/Code/pressbooks-dev/trellis/group_vars/development/wordpress_sites.yml` to reflect your desired local development site URL, replacing all instances of `example.dev` with `pressbooks.dev`, `pressbooks.test` or whatever you prefer. For example:

    wordpress_sites:
      example.com:
        site_hosts:
          - canonical: pressbooks.dev
            redirects:
              - www.pressbooks.dev
        local_path: ../site # path targeting local Bedrock site directory (relative to Ansible root)
        admin_email: admin@pressbooks.dev
        multisite:
          enabled: true
          subdomains: false
        ssl:
          enabled: false
          provider: self-signed
        cache:
          enabled: false
        env:
          domain_current_site: pressbooks.dev
          wp_home: http://pressbooks.dev
          wp_siteurl: http://pressbooks.dev/wp

You can leave `example.com` as is unless you plan on setting up matching staging or production environments. In that case, you will need to update all instances of `example.com` in `~/Code/pressbooks-dev/trellis/group_vars/` to a consistent value. If you are interested in configuring a staging or production environment, you should consult the [Trellis docs][15] as that is outside the scope of this tutorial.

## 4\. Launch

Trellis for Windows requires Administrator privileges when doing the initial provisioning. If UAC is enabled, make sure the initial `vagrant up` is run from a command prompt with elevated privileges (Run as Administrator).

Start the default Windows Command Prompt (right click, run as Administrator)

Change to the `~/Code/pressbooks-dev/trellis/` directory and run `vagrant up`:

    cd %HOMEPATH%\\Code\\pressbooks-dev\\trellis
    vagrant up

Fully provisioning your development environment may take up to 30 minutes.

When finished, do a `vagrant halt`, exit the Administrator Command Prompt, then redo `vagrant up` in a regular user privileged Command Prompt.

## 5\. Development Tools

### Login:

The default Pressbooks username:password is `admin:admin`

### Logs:

Access and error logs are located on the VM in following directory:

    /srv/www/example.com/logs/
    

### Unit Testing and Coding Standards

Unit testing in the VM:

    vagrant ssh
    cd /srv/www/example.com/current
    bin/install-wp-tests.sh pressbooks_tests pressbooks_test '' 127.0.0.1 latest true
    composer test
    

Coding standards in the VM:

    vagrant ssh
    cd /srv/www/example.com/current
    composer standards
    

### Asset Building

We use [webpack][6] wrapped in [Laravel Mix][16] to build plugin assets (CSS and JavaScript) for Pressbooks.

  1.  At the command prompt from the Pressbooks plugin directory, e.g. `~/Code/pressbooks-dev/site/web/app/plugins/pressbooks`, run `yarn` to install build dependencies.
  2.  Then, run `yarn run dev` or `yarn run production` to build your plugin assets (`yarn run production` will add a version hash to the asset manifest for browser cache busting).

### Updates

In [Git Bash][8]:


    cd ~/Code/pressbooks-dev/site
    composer.phar update pressbooks/pressbooks --with-dependencies
    composer.phar update pressbooks/pressbooks-publisher --with-dependencies
    composer.phar update pressbooks/pressbooks-book --with-dependencies
